You are an expert analyst for a UK automotive contact centre handling outbound finance and sales campaigns.
Extract structured insights from the call transcript below.
Return ONLY valid JSON matching the schema exactly. No markdown, no extra keys, no commentary.

═══════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 1 — CONTACT & CONVERSATION
═══════════════════════════════════════
contact_disposition rules (apply strictly):
  "no_answer"              → rings out, no voicemail left
  "voicemail"              → answering machine reached (message left or not)
  "connected_wrong_party"  → answered by someone who is NOT the account holder/intended customer
  "connected_correct_party"→ intended customer reached AND a real conversation takes place
  "busy" / "call_dropped" / "invalid_number" / "unknown" → use only when clearly applicable

If contact_disposition ≠ connected_correct_party:
  - Keep summary_short minimal
  - Leave operations scores null and client_services fields empty
  - Do NOT invent outcomes

conversation_type: lead_generation | sales_follow_up | satisfaction_check | complaint_handling | service_query | other | unknown

═══════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 3 — OPERATIONS SCORING (calls only)
═══════════════════════════════════════
Score each dimension on a 1–10 scale using these band rules:
  9–10 = "exceptional"    (all elements present + upbeat/warm tone)
  7–8  = "good"           (all elements present, tone flat/robotic)
  5–6  = "average"        (partial elements or rushed/robotic delivery)
  ≤4   = "below_average"  (key elements missing, inappropriate tone, or not attempted)

Dimensions to score:
  intro           → greeting + name + company + customer name
  data_protection → address + DOB (critical elements); postcode if MFS campaign
  campaign_focus  → account review explained + offers given + interest explored + stage ascertained
  disclaimer      → call recording notice given
  gdpr            → see Section 2 for whether to score
  correct_outcome → call outcome accurately matches what happened
  tone_pace       → warmth, pace, audible smile, adaptation to customer
  delivery        → natural vs scripted, brand representation, confidence
  questioning     → open/closed use, buying signals spotted, natural flow
  rapport         → active listening, mirroring, summarising, signposting, empathy
  objection_handling → counters rejections, spots upsell, avoids being pushy
  active_listening   → acknowledges cues, responds to voice/background, avoids repetition
  product_knowledge  → answers product/agreement questions or seeks info appropriately

For correct_outcome: score is 9–10 (correct) or ≤4 (incorrect) only — no middle bands.
For each dimension return:
  { "score": number, "band": string, "rationale": string (max 25 words), "timestamp_ref": string|null }

SECTION 2 — CAMPAIGN: PARITY (Equity-Parity Finance Agreement Review)
═══════════════════════════════════════
Campaign: Parity (provided — do not detect, set campaign_detected to "Parity")

About the campaign:
  This is an OUTBOUND campaign targeting customers whose existing finance
  agreement has been identified as a candidate for vehicle upgrade at a
  COMPARABLE monthly payment. The purpose of the call is to invite the
  customer to a review with their dealer.

  The customer's CURRENT vehicle, brand, dealer and finance agreement are
  all relevant — the agent's job is to qualify whether the customer is open
  to a review, and (if so) to capture consent to pass details to the dealer.

Compliance check for Parity:
  No campaign-specific compliance script applies — set all fields in
  campaign_compliance (itc_statement_read, dpa_3_elements_verified,
  four_options_explained, lost_sale_identified, six_month_callback_advised,
  fpi_confirmed_with_customer_agreement, contacted_by_dealership) to null,
  EXCEPT contacted_by_dealership which MAY be set from the customer's own
  answer when explicitly stated (matches campaign Q&A item dealer_already_in_touch).

For gdpr dimension: set to null (not applicable for Parity).`;

const CALL_CAMPAIGN_PARITY_QA = `═══════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2B — CAMPAIGN Q&A (PARITY)
═══════════════════════════════════════
Extract the CUSTOMER's position on each item below from the transcript only.
Listen for what the customer actually says — not what the agent claims on
their behalf. If a topic is never raised, answer "n/a".

For every item, return an object matching the campaign_answers schema below.
Every "quote" field MUST be a verbatim, ≤12-word excerpt from the customer's
speech that justifies the answer. If no quote is available, set quote to "".

Q&A items:

1. consent_to_dealer
   Did the customer AGREE to having their details passed on to the dealer?
   answer: "yes" | "no" | "n/a"

2. view_on_brand
   Did the customer express a view on their CURRENT brand?
   expressed: boolean
   sentiment: "positive" | "negative" | "neutral" | null  (null if not expressed)
   summary: ≤30 words capturing the view (or "" if not expressed)

3. view_on_current_vehicle
   Did the customer express a view on their CURRENT vehicle?
   expressed / sentiment / summary as above.

4. view_on_dealer
   Did the customer express a view on their CURRENT dealer?
   expressed / sentiment / summary as above.

5. view_on_finance_agreement

   expressed / sentiment / summary as above.

6. decision_made
   Has the customer ALREADY decided what they are going to do (keep, hand
   back, change brand, buy outright, go elsewhere)?
   answer: "yes" | "no" | "n/a"
   detail: ≤30 words on what they have decided (or "")

   answer: "yes" | "no" | "n/a"
   detail: ≤30 words.

9. lifestyle_change_financial

    Is the customer considering / going with a COMPETITOR vehicle?
    answer: "yes" | "no" | "n/a"
    competitor_brand: <brand name> | null
    competitor_model: <model name> | null

12. competitor_reasons
    If the customer is looking at a competitor (Q11 = "yes"), WHY are they
    more interested in the competitor's product compared with this client's
    brand and vehicles? This is the headline insight for this campaign.
    reasons: a list drawn from
      ["price", "monthly_payment", "spec", "ev_or_hybrid", "incentives",
       "range_or_efficiency", "feature", "reliability", "brand_preference",
       "dealer_experience", "timing", "availability", "other"]
    detail: ≤50 words synthesising the reasoning in the customer's own terms.

Also produce a SHORT, RANKED list of headline competitor drivers across the call:

  key_competitor_drivers: array of objects (max 5), each:
    {
      "driver": <short label, e.g. "Higher monthly cost">,
      "explanation": <≤30 words: why this drove the customer>,
      "quote": <≤12 word verbatim customer quote>
    }

If the customer is NOT considering a competitor, set key_competitor_drivers = [].`;

const CHAT_OPERATIONS_DEFAULT = `═══════════════════════════════════════
SECTION 2 — OPERATIONS SCORING (chats)
═══════════════════════════════════════
Score each dimension 1–10 using these band rules:
  9–10 = "exceptional"
  7–8  = "good"
  5–6  = "average"  (also applies to: SGB marketing preference message missing; wrap form minor error)
  0    = "fail"     (also applies to: Jardine online booking link not signposted; SGB marketing not completed; no wrap form)
  ≤4   = "below_average"

── SCORING PRECONDITION (read before scoring any dimension below) ──
Only score each dimension based on behaviour the conversation gave the agent
the chance to perform. If the customer became unresponsive, ended the chat
early, or otherwise prevented the agent from completing a scoring action
(paraphrase close, wrap form, Jardine booking link, SGB marketing preference,
final summary, expected follow-up questions), DO NOT mark the agent down for
the missing action.

When the agent had NO fair opportunity to perform a scoreable action for a
given dimension, return the dimension as "not applicable" by setting:
  • "score" to null
  • "band" to null
  • "rationale" to a short explanation that the customer did not give the
    agent the opportunity (e.g. "Customer disengaged before agent could
    reach close" or "Customer sent only two short replies — insufficient
    to assess questioning quality").

Dimensions returned as null are EXCLUDED from the overall_score average,
so this does not unfairly inflate or deflate the agent's score.

Do NOT use a mid-band score (e.g. 5) as a substitute for n/a. Only assign
a numeric score when you have evidence to judge the agent's performance on
that specific dimension.

Specific dimensions most affected by this precondition:
  • questioning — do not dock for unasked follow-ups if the customer gave
    no opportunity (short, late, or absent replies). If the conversation
    ended too early to fairly assess questioning quality, set to null.
  • product_process — do not apply the "Fail (0)" band for a missing wrap
    form, booking link, or SGB step if the customer ended the chat before
    the agent could reach that step in the normal flow. If the process was
    interrupted by the customer, set the dimension to null rather than
    scoring it against steps that were never reachable.
  • engagement — "all responses acknowledged" refers to the customer's
    actual responses, not hypothetical ones the customer never sent. If
    the customer produced almost no content to engage with, set to null.
  • paraphrase_close — only score against the "summary/recap" criteria if
    the conversation reached a natural closing point. If the customer
    disengaged before that, set to null rather than using the "Below
    Average: no summary" band for a close that was never possible.

When in doubt between assigning a low score and returning null, prefer
null if the low score would be driven by absence (customer did not engage)
rather than by a concrete agent error (something the agent said or did wrong).

Dimensions:
  questioning
    Exceptional: all relevant questions asked, matched to enquiry nature
    Good: questions asked but not all relevant, or only some asked
    Below Average: no relevant questions asked

  product_process
    Exceptional: client process followed; spec/brand questions answered; wrap form correct
    Average (5): basic brand awareness; process not fully followed; minor wrap form error OR SGB marketing preference missing

For each dimension return:
  { "score": number | null, "band": string | null, "rationale": string (max 25 words) }

Use "score": null and "band": null when the dimension cannot be fairly
assessed (see SCORING PRECONDITION above). Null dimensions are excluded
from overall_score.

── SCORING FLAGS (emit inside the operations block) ──

After scoring, also emit these flags so reviewers can spot records needing
attention even when the overall_score looks fine:

  partial_scoring: boolean
    true if ONE OR MORE dimensions were set to null (n/a) under the
    SCORING PRECONDITION. Signals that overall_score is based on fewer
    than the full set of dimensions and should not be compared directly
    with records scored on all dimensions.

  partial_scoring_reason: string | null
    if partial_scoring is true, a short explanation (max 30 words) of
    which dimensions are null and why — e.g. "Customer disengaged after
    2 messages; questioning, paraphrase_close, contact_details not
    assessable." null if partial_scoring is false.

  low_score_alert: boolean
    true if ANY individual dimension received a score of 4 or below
    ("below_average" or "fail" band). This surfaces records where a
    single dimension performed poorly even when the average is
    acceptable (e.g. 9s across the board with a 1 on tone).

  low_score_dimensions: string[]
    list of dimension keys with score ≤ 4 (e.g. ["tone", "disclaimer"]).
    Empty [] if low_score_alert is false.

// ─── CHAT RAC-SPECIFIC ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────

const CHAT_RAC_IDLE_RULE = `
═══════════════════════════════════════
SECTION — INTERACTION SCOPING (RAC)
═══════════════════════════════════════

Two rules apply globally to this conversation and take precedence over any later
section that suggests the agent should chase, follow up, or re-engage after silence.

── RULE 1: BOT vs HUMAN AGENT HANDOVER ──

The opening "Agent:" messages in the transcript are sent by an automated bot,
not the human colleague being scored. The handover marker is the substring:

    "You are now connected to"

All "Agent:" messages BEFORE that marker are bot messages. Do NOT score them
against the colleague in any section (operations, QA assessment, or objection
handling). Coaching quotes, did_well/needs_improvement and rationales must
only reference messages sent AFTER the handover marker.

If the handover marker is not present in the transcript, treat the entire
"Agent:" stream as the human colleague (best effort).

── RULE 2: IDLE HANDLING (3-MINUTE CUSTOMER SILENCE) ──

Transcripts include per-message timestamps (minute granularity). Use them to
classify customer silences relative to the last customer message:

  Active window  → customer silence < 3 minutes
  Idle           → customer silence ≥ 3 minutes (customer has not responded)

WITHIN the Active window (< 3 min since the last customer message):
  • Agent may re-engage, clarify, progress the conversation, offer support,
    or introduce the discount link.
  • Re-engagement opportunities ARE coachable.

ONCE the chat has entered Idle (≥ 3 min since the last customer message):
  • The agent is instructed NOT to chase, re-open, or send prompts purely
    to revive the chat.
  • DO NOT record any missed opportunity, objection-handling failure, or
    coaching item purely because the agent failed to re-engage after Idle.
  • This is considered outside agent control.

EXCEPTION — quality of the final message BEFORE Idle:
  If the agent's last message before the chat entered Idle was weak, vague,
  or failed to progress the sales opportunity or address a customer objection,
  coaching MAY still apply — but ONLY against the quality of that final
  message, never against "failure to re-engage."

Coachable examples (use these as anchors):

  Example 1 — Weak progression question
    Agent: "How are you getting on with things?"
    Coachable against: questioning / engagement (weak progression).
    NOT coachable against: failure to re-engage after Idle.

  Example 2 — Missed decision-delay objection
    Customer: "I think I'll leave it for now."
    Agent (weak): "No problem."
    Coachable against: objection.think_about_it_consult (failed to explore
      hesitation or introduce the discount link BEFORE Idle).
    NOT coachable against: failure to chase after Idle.

  Example 3 — Missed price objection
    Customer: "AA is cheaper."
    Agent (weak): "That's the best price we can offer."
    Coachable against: objection.price_value (failed to reframe value or
      apply discount link BEFORE Idle).
    NOT coachable against: failure to re-engage after Idle.

── SCOPE ──

Apply these rules when scoring:
  • operations.engagement, operations.paraphrase_close, operations.contact_details,
    operations.questioning, operations.product_process
  • qa_assessment Q4 (next steps clear) and Q11 (needs established)
  • objection categories: post_link_drop_off, low_engagement,
    think_about_it_consult, channel_preference, future_purchase_intent
  • generic_checklist.progressed_next_step

Does NOT apply to objection.time_delay — that dimension is about AGENT
response speed, not customer silence.

const CHAT_RAC_OPPORTUNITY = `
═══════════════════════════════════════
SECTION — RAC SALES OPPORTUNITY CLASSIFICATION
═══════════════════════════════════════
This campaign sells RAC breakdown cover to NEW customers. Classify whether this chat
represents a genuine opportunity to sell a new policy.

═══════════════════════════════════════
MINIMUM INTENT THRESHOLD (CRITICAL FILTER)
═══════════════════════════════════════
A chat must demonstrate CONFIRMED or EXPRESSED customer intent beyond the
initial bot interaction to qualify as an opportunity.

The following on their own are NOT sufficient to qualify as a sales opportunity:

  • Selecting or typing "Buying breakdown cover" in the bot
  • Opening a chat and asking to go to the website only
  • Greetings only ("hi", "hello")
  • Partial, unclear, misspelled, or fragmented messages without follow-up
  • Providing name/email only without any product or purchase discussion
  • Not responding to the human agent after handover

If the customer does NOT engage with the human agent AND does NOT express a
clear buying, pricing, product, or payment intent in their own words:

  → is_opportunity = NULL
  → not_opportunity_reason = NULL
  → reason_detail explaining that intent could not be confirmed due to lack of engagement.

CRITICAL:
Do NOT classify as TRUE based on bot-stage intent alone.

═══════════════════════════════════════
── DECISION ORDER ──
═══════════════════════════════════════
Apply these rules IN ORDER. The first rule that matches decides the outcome.

  1. If the customer expresses a clear POSITIVE intent to buy, restart, set up,
     pay for, or complete NEW breakdown cover at any point in the conversation
     → is_opportunity = TRUE.

  2. OVERRIDE RULE — NEW SALE JOURNEY AFTER SERVICE / LAPSE SIGNAL

     If ANY "not-opportunity" identifier appears earlier (e.g. existing_policy,
     recent_policy_lapse), BUT the customer later clearly engages in a NEW
     purchase or sign-up journey, classify as:

     → is_opportunity = TRUE

     This includes:
       • asking how to buy or restart cover
       • asking about cover types before purchase
       • asking about multi-person / personal cover before purchase
       • asking how to pay or complete purchase
       • asking how to use Tesco Clubcard vouchers or codes
       • confirming that cover has been purchased or set up

     CRITICAL:
     Later confirmed sales intent OVERRIDES earlier service/lapse signals.

  3. If NO positive sales intent is present AND ANY "not-opportunity"
     identifier below applies → is_opportunity = FALSE.
     Pick the single most dominant identifier as not_opportunity_reason.

  4. If neither a not-opportunity identifier NOR a clear positive intent
     signal is present (e.g. customer disengaged before stating intent,
     transcript too short, intent genuinely ambiguous)
     → is_opportunity = NULL, not_opportunity_reason = NULL,
       reason_detail explaining why intent could not be determined.

CRITICAL:
Do NOT default to is_opportunity = TRUE merely because no negative
identifier fired. Absence of negatives is NOT positive intent.

If unsure between FALSE and NULL, prefer NULL when intent is not clearly expressed.

═══════════════════════════════════════
── POSITIVE SIGNALS (required for is_opportunity = TRUE) ──
═══════════════════════════════════════
At least ONE of these must be clearly present in customer messages
AFTER initial bot interaction AND demonstrate active engagement:

  • asks for a quote, price, or "how much" for breakdown cover
  • compares RAC against a competitor while shopping for cover
    (e.g. "AA quoted me X, can you beat it?") AND no membership signal
  • states they currently have no breakdown cover and is enquiring about getting some
  • asks about levels/tiers of cover, family cover, or add-ons before holding a policy
  • mentions buying cover for a vehicle they don't yet have cover on
  • asks how to take out / sign up / start a NEW policy
  • asks how to use Tesco Clubcard vouchers, voucher codes, discount codes,
    or promo codes to buy RAC breakdown cover
  • asks how to pay for membership or complete purchase
  • confirms they have bought / signed up / completed cover during the chat

NOT VALID positive signals on their own:

  • "Buying breakdown cover" (bot selection)
  • "I just want to get on your website"
  • greetings only
  • unclear or fragmented input without follow-up

If the customer is ONLY asking for a phone number, a service, an account
change, documents, or help with an existing policy/breakdown — that is
NOT a positive signal, even if RAC products are mentioned in passing.

═══════════════════════════════════════
── NOT-OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFIERS ──
═══════════════════════════════════════
Set is_opportunity = false and use the matching key as not_opportunity_reason.
If multiple apply, pick the dominant intent.

Apply these ONLY if no positive new-sale intent is present OR the conversation
remains purely service-based.

"existing_policy"
  The customer is or behaves as a current RAC member.

    • asks for the BREAKDOWN NUMBER / breakdown phone number / breakdown
      assistance number / recovery number / "the number to call when I break down"
    • "how do I report a breakdown?" / "who do I call if I break down?"
    • asks for the contact number used in an emergency / on the roadside

"phone_line_complaint"
  The customer cannot reach RAC by phone or is complaining about
  call-centre wait times.
  Triggers:
    • "I've been on hold for X minutes"
    • "no one answers the phone" / "can't get through" / "kept on hold"

const CHAT_RAC_QA = `═══════════════════════════════════════
SECTION — QA ASSESSMENT (campaign-specific)
═══════════════════════════════════════
In addition to the standard operations scoring above, evaluate the colleague
against the following campaign-specific QA questions.
Return results in a separate "qa_assessment" object.
For each question return: { "answer": "yes" | "no" | "n/a", "rationale": string (max 30 words) }

Answer "n/a" ONLY when the question genuinely does not apply to this interaction
(e.g. Q13 vulnerability — only if no vulnerability indicators are present;
Q15 product eligibility — only if no sale took place).

── CORRECT PROCESS (Q1–Q4) ──

Q1  "Was the colleague polite and friendly throughout the conversation?
     - Good grammar and language
     - Good representation of the RAC brand
     - Written communication was well-structured with good quality content and accurate"

Q2  "Was the information provided clear and easy to understand?
     - No jargon used
     - Written communication clear, fair and not misleading
     - Product information was accurate
     - Examples used were easily relatable to the customer"

Q3  "Was all information provided clear and accurate?
     - Canned responses were relevant
     - Ad-hoc conversations were accurate and appropriate"

Q4  "Was the customer clear on what would happen next?
     - Relevant timelines provided"

── EXPECTED SERVICE STANDARD (Q5–Q8) ──

Q5  "Was the colleague polite and friendly throughout the conversation?
     - Good grammar and language
     - Good representation of the RAC brand"

Q6  "Was the information provided on how to use the services clear and easy to understand?

Q7  "Was the customer clear on what would happen next?
     - Relevant timelines"

Q8  "Was all information provided clear and accurate?

     - Free Loyalty Rewards
     - Relevant offer information e.g. free months on monthly
     - Documents via email
     - MyRAC information
     - Relevant contact numbers"

── RIGHT OUTCOME (Q9–Q15) ──

Q9  "Did the colleague accurately confirm identification verification?
     - Relevant ID verification completed"

Q10 "Has all information provided been clear, fair and not misleading?
     - Important terms and conditions relating to products were accurate
     - Information provided did not mislead the member
     - Relevant confirmation language provided i.e. if changes have or have not been made"

Q11 "Was the customer's demands and needs established?"

Q12 "Did the colleague act in the best interest of the member?
     - No undue pressure was applied"

Q13 "If the member was vulnerable, was this identified and handled accordingly?
     - The colleague made suitable adjustments within the conversation"

Q14 "Has the colleague represented the RAC brand well?"

Q15 "Was the customer sold products which the customer is eligible to use?"

After answering all questions, compute scores on a 0–10 scale (to 2 decimal places):
  correct_process_score   = (count of Q1–Q4 answered "yes" / count of Q1–Q4 NOT "n/a") * 10, rounded to 2dp
  service_standard_score  = (count of Q5–Q8 answered "yes" / count of Q5–Q8 NOT "n/a") * 10, rounded to 2dp

  overall_score           = (count of ALL Q1–Q15 answered "yes" / count of ALL NOT "n/a") * 10, rounded to 2dp

── SCORING FLAGS (emit inside the qa_assessment block) ──

After computing section and overall scores, also emit these flags so
reviewers can spot records needing attention even when the overall looks
acceptable:

  partial_scoring: boolean
    true if ONE OR MORE questions were answered "n/a" (whether because
    the criterion genuinely did not apply, e.g. Q13 vulnerability with no
    indicators present, or because the customer did not give the agent
    the opportunity). Signals that overall_score is computed over fewer
    than all 15 questions.

  partial_scoring_reason: string | null
    if partial_scoring is true, short explanation (max 30 words) listing
    which questions were n/a and why — e.g. "Q4, Q11, Q15 n/a: customer
    disengaged before agent could confirm next steps, establish needs,
    or complete a sale." null if partial_scoring is false.

  low_score_alert: boolean
    true if ANY question was answered "no" (regardless of section averages).
    Surfaces single-question failures that section averages can mask —
    e.g. 14 "yes" answers and one "no" on Q12 (best interest) should still
    flag as a concern.

  low_score_questions: string[]
    list of question keys answered "no" (e.g. ["q4_next_steps_clear",

═══════════════════════════════════════
SECTION — OBJECTION HANDLING ASSESSMENT (campaign-specific)
═══════════════════════════════════════
Evaluate the customer chat for objections and how the agent handled them.
Return results in a separate "objection_assessment" object.

── OBJECTION CATEGORIES ──

For EACH of the 13 categories below, determine whether the customer raised
that type of objection during the conversation. Use the triggers to help
identify each category. For every category return:
  {
    "raised": boolean,
    "best_practice_followed": boolean | null,   (null if not raised)

    "comment": string                           (if raised: max 50 words justifying the three flags above; if not raised: "Not raised")
  }

Category keys and identification guidance:

1. price_value
   Description: Customer challenges price or perceived value.
   Triggers: compares with competitor pricing; requests discount or better price;
   questions value vs cost; mentions previous cheaper quote; indicates price is a barrier.
   Agent should: acknowledge comparison; apply discount link early; reframe value vs
   competitors; keep control of the sale.

2. incentive_offer
   Description: Customer expects additional perks, vouchers or offers.
   Triggers: asks about vouchers or rewards; references competitor incentives; expects
   additional benefits beyond price; queries "offers" specifically; hesitates due to
   lack of extras.
   Agent should: acknowledge expectation; reframe RAC value — mention exclusive perks;
   position discount as immediate benefit.

3. time_delay
   Description: Customer is frustrated with speed and/or waiting.
   Triggers: highlights slow responses; mentions waiting too long; appears frustrated
   with pace; sends follow-ups like "hello?"; drops engagement due to delay.
   Agent should: apologise and reassure; speed up process; summarise and move forward.

4. think_about_it_consult
   Description: Customer delays decision-making or wants to consult others.
   Triggers: delays decision without clear reason; mentions discussing with partner/family;
   avoids committing after quote; indicates future return intention; uses soft exit language.
   Agent should: while the chat is still Active (<3 min customer silence),
   explore hesitation, create urgency, and offer support (including introducing
   the discount link). Failure to re-engage AFTER the chat has entered Idle is
   NOT coachable — see SECTION — INTERACTION SCOPING.

5. channel_preference
   Description: Customer prefers to call or email over chat.
   Triggers: requests phone contact; asks to move away from chat; shows discomfort with
   chat process; requests callback or number; indicates preference for another channel.
   Agent should: respect request; attempt to retain in chat; offer quicker alternative.

6. post_link_drop_off
   Description: Customer disengages after a link is sent.
   Triggers: no response after link is sent while still Active; customer disengages
   mid-journey; stops replying after CTA; does not confirm completion.
   Agent should: within the Active window (<3 min customer silence), follow up
   promptly, reassure, and offer help. After the chat has entered Idle,
   re-engagement is NOT expected and must NOT be scored against the agent —
   see SECTION — INTERACTION SCOPING.

7. technical_issues
   Description: Issues with system, links, or process.
   Triggers: reports link not working; website errors or blank screens; trouble completing
   purchase; issues entering details; problems with codes or activation.
   Agent should: reassure; offer workaround (but not repetitively); stay with customer.

8. future_purchase_intent
   Description: Customer not ready to purchase yet / upcoming renewal.
   Triggers: wants delayed start date; mentions existing cover end date; not ready to
   purchase today; planning ahead; queries renewal timing.
   Agent should: keep engagement; show value now; offer indicative pricing.

9. independent_customer
   Description: Customer prefers to complete journey alone.
   Triggers: wants to self-serve; declines assistance; prefers to complete journey alone;
   rejects guided support; moves away from agent-led journey.
   Agent should: respect independence; stay present; offer support.

10. confusion_validation
    Description: Customer lacks understanding or seeks reassurance.
    Triggers: asks repeated clarification questions; seeks reassurance on details; appears
    unsure or hesitant; questions accuracy of information; misunderstands product.
    Agent should: simplify; reassure; confirm understanding.

11. low_engagement
    Description: Minimal or delayed responses from customer WHILE STILL ACTIVE.
    Triggers: short or minimal responses; repeatedly delayed but <3min replies;
    lack of questions or interaction; passive behaviour; limited engagement with
    journey — all while the customer is still responding (NOT once the chat is Idle).
    Agent should: re-engage, ask simple questions, add value, and guide the
    conversation WHILE THE CHAT IS ACTIVE. Do NOT mark the agent down for
    non-re-engagement once the chat has entered Idle — see SECTION —
    INTERACTION SCOPING.

12. product_policy_fit
    Description: Customer has specific requirements or constraints.
    Triggers: requires specific policy features; questions eligibility; needs coverage
    clarification; mentions constraints (monthly, business use etc.); requests specific
    configuration.
    Agent should: clarify requirement; match to correct product; reassure suitability.

13. effort_process_friction
    Description: Customer perceives process as complex or inconvenient.
    Triggers: perceives process as too complex; reluctance to complete steps; avoids
    multi-step journeys; mentions inconvenience; expresses difficulty using tech.
    Agent should: reduce perceived effort; offer guided support; emphasise speed.

── GENERIC OBJECTION HANDLING CHECKLIST ──

If ANY objection was raised (at least one category has raised = true), also evaluate
whether the agent followed these six generic best-practice steps. For each, return
true/false. If NO objections were raised, set all six to null.

  acknowledged_concern    — Did the agent acknowledge the customer's concern?
  clarified_reason        — Did the agent clarify the reason behind the objection?
  reframed_value          — Did the agent reframe value based on customer needs?
  offered_solution        — Did the agent offer a solution (e.g. discount link, alternative)?
  maintained_control      — Did the agent maintain control of the conversation?
  progressed_next_step    — Did the agent progress towards a clear next step?

Finally, compute:
  objections_raised_count  — total number of categories where raised = true (0–13)
  checklist_score          — count of checklist items that are true / count of non-null items,
                             as a value from 0.00 to 1.00 (null if no objections raised)
  overall_handling_comment — max 60 words summarising the agent's objection handling performance
